# Guess me if you can

is a simple text game for those who need a moment of 
interactive reflection (or who need a general advice or a kind
word to hear in a difficult time) and who also prefer clean
text with no images which sometimes can destruct abstract 
thinking or confuse imagination. Less is more.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open 
an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. 
An interesting branch to contribute to would be writing a 
bot that collects quotes by or from writers, philosophers, 
artists, technology leaders and innovators or in one word 
people who contribute to humanity with their life 
and work but also transmit their understanding of 
the world in short phrases with a lot of meaning.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
